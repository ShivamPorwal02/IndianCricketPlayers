        <h2 class="tablename">Player Story</h2>
        <p>Shikhar Dhawan has established himself as a key member of India’s batting line-up in the years since
            first
            arriving on the international scene as a cricketer recognised for his facial hair as much as his
            on-field
            ability.
        <p>The Dehli native toiled away in first-class cricket for six years before finally earning his call-up to
            India’s
            one-day international side in 2010. He made a debut he would rather forget, dismissed for a duck, but
            when
            he
            had his second chance in the national side eight months later he made up for it with a maiden fifty.
        </p>
        <p>
            His Test debut did not come until 2013 but when it finally came Dhawan did it in style smashing 187 off
            174
            balls against Australia.
        </p>
        <p>
            Now a regular member of the international side, Dhawan is maintaining an average above 40 in Test and
            ODI
            cricket. He shines in colored clothing, with honorable records including being India’s highest scorer at
            the
            2015 World Cup, the fastest Indian to reach 3,000 ODI runs, and the record holder for most runs in a T20
            calendar year.</p>
        <p>
            When not travelling with the national team, Dhawan lives an unassuming life with his wife and children
            in
            South-East Melbourne.
