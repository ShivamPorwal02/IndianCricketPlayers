    <p>A tall, elegant right-hand batsman who can keep wicket in a crisis, KL Rahul is among the most highly rated
        opening batsmen in India's next generation. Rahul was a part of India's squad in the 2010 Under-19 World Cup and
        made his first-class debut later that year. Having taken a while to establish himself as a first-class
        cricketer, he enjoyed a breakthrough 2013-14 season, laying the foundation for Karnataka's Ranji Trophy victory
        with 1033 runs, which included three centuries, three nineties, and a Man-of-the-Match performance in the final.

    <p> Rahul attracted plenty of attention at the subsequent IPL auction, and finally went to Sunrisers Hyderabad for
        Rs. 1 crore (US$ 166,000 approx.). He was a regular member of their side in the 2014 season, mostly as
        wicketkeeper-batsman, but his contributions with the bat were steady rather than spectacular.
    </p>
    <p>
        In the long format, however, his technique and application have impressed some of Indian cricket's most
        respected names.
        These include Rahul Dravid, with whom Rahul shares not just a name but also a strong rapport, regularly seeking
        him out for technical and mental advice.
    </p>
    <p>
        Rahul had a middling tour of Australia with the India A team in
        July-August 2014, getting starts each time he batted in the unofficial Tests but only managing a top score of
        52. But his appetite for runs was back to normal by the time the 2014-15 domestic season began, and twin
        centuries in the Duleep Trophy final earned him a place in India's Test squad on their tour of Australia.</p>
