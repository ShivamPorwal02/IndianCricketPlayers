    <p>Yuzvendra Chahal is an attacking legspinner who first attracted attention when he took 34 wickets in the National
        Under-19 Cooch Behar Trophy in 2009, ending the tournament as its leading wicket-taker. A former chess player
        who represented India at junior levels, Chahal made his first-class debut for Haryana the same year and was
        signed by Mumbai Indians in 2011 to be part of their IPL squad.</p>
    <p>He didn't play a game that season but was still named in Mumbai's Champions League T20 squad the same year. It
        was in the Champions League that he got an extended run in the side - he featured in the playing XI in all the
        matches and starred in Mumbai's win in the final with a spell of 3-0-9-2. However, in the next two years with
        Mumbai, he managed only one game. His IPL fortunes mirrored those in domestic cricket, where he played in only
        eight matches in three seasons from 2011-12 onwards and picked up just 16 wickets. </p>
    <p>
        It was with Royal Challengers Bangalore, though, that he found the bulk of his success. He was their highest
        wicket-taker for two years running since the 2015 season and by virtue of that earned his first India caps in
        ODIs and T20Is on a tour of Zimbabwe in June 2016. While that series may have been seen as an opportunity to
        blood new players into international cricket, Chahal was called up again into the Indian T20 line-up to face
        England in January 2017, and delivered in style in the deciding game: his 6 for 25 in that match in Bangalore
        was part of an England collaspse of 8 for 8, and the third-best figures till then in T20Is.
