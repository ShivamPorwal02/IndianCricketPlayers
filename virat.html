        <h2 class="tablename">Player Story</h2>
        <p>There’s a very good reason Virat Kohli is referred to as the ‘King’. The Indian captain’s batting record
            is
            hardly matched by any other cricketer on the planet, with his aggressive approach to the game also
            making
            him a
            player fans flock to watch.
        </p>
        <p>Kohli always dreamed of representing his country in cricket and had his first opportunity as a teenager
            when
            he
            played for the India under-19 team in 2006, guiding the same team to a World Cup win in 2008.
        </p>
        <p> His senior international career took off soon after when Kohli made his one-day international debut
            against
            Sri
            Lanka in August 2008. He now has more than 35 one-day hundreds and many other fine performances to his
            name,
            with a high-score of 183 against Pakistan in 2012. He averages more than 50 in 50-over cricket.
        </p>
        <p> Kohli has been equally as impressive in the five-day game. He averages over 50 and has made 17 centuries
            and
            14
            fifties in 59 Tests. As of January 2019, he was the #1 ranked batsman in the world in both the ODI and
            Test
            formats.
        </p>
        <p> Kohli’s brilliance with the bat is matched by his skills as a captain in all three forms of the game.
            While
            a
            major tournament win still eludes the Indian’s under his leadership, the side has regularly held the #1
            world
            ranking in both Test and ODI cricket. He has the greatest Test Match winning percentage as an Indian
            captain,
            with a most recent triumph being a 2-1 series victory against Australia – the first ever Indian series
            win
            on
            Australian soil.</p>
