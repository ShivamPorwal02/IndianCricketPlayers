        <p>An exciting batsman who made his one-day international debut in 2010, Rohit Sharma had appeared in more than
            60
            ODIs and 20 T20Is by the time he was 24 years old.


        </p>
        <p> He suffered disappointment in 2011 when he was dropped from the ICC Cricket World Cup squad but has had some
            outstanding performances through more than 150 ODI games including a high score of 209 in late 2013.
        </p>
        <p> But his biggest feat to date came in late 2014, when he blitzed Sri Lanka to score 264 from 173 balls – the
            highest individual ODI score in history.
        </p>
        <p>Sharma’s Test debut was longer in the making coming in November 2013.

            He made two centuries in his first two Tests but has struggled from then on to score consistent runs.</p>
